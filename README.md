# Jbuilder Jets

This gem simply makes jbuilder compatible with Jets. It's a fork of [rails/jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder). Some notes:

* The v2.11.5 tag is the starting point.
* Made changes to work with [Jets](https://rubyonjets.com).
* Renamed the gem jbuilder-jets so we can have a published gem that's directly usable.
